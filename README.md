### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset. This project aims to clean and format the data to ensure accuracy and then conduct exploratory analysis to answer business-related questions that can provide insights into Netflix's content library.

### Dataset
The dataset includes information about various content on Netflix, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries, with attributes like title, director, casts, country, date added, duration, and more.

### Objectives

The project has two main objectives:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Address duplicate values, correct inconsistent formatting, and standardize the dataset for further analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an in-depth analysis to answer 15 business-related questions based on the Netflix content data.

<br>

### Tools
The main tools used for this project:
- MySQL Workbench: for data cleaning and exploratory
- Excel: the CSV file containing Netflix_titles
